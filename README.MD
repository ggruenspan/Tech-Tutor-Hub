## Getting Started

To get started with the development of Tech Tutor Hub client-side, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggruenspan/tech-tutor-hub-client.git
   cd tech-tutor-hub-client
    ```
2. Install Dependencies
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
You need to run the application on HTTPS. To achieve this, follow these steps from [Medium.com]:
1. First, open PowerShell as administrator
    Run
    ```bash
    Get-ExecutionPolicy 
    ```
    If it returns Restricted, then run 
    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process.
    ```
2. Run this command to install Chocolatey
    ```bash
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
3. After install Chocolatey, we can install mkcert using
    ```bash
    choco install mkcert
    ```
4. Now we create a trusted certificate authority in our systemâ€™s root store
    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```
5. Run this to valid HTTPS certificates for localhost
    ```bash
    # You can put the files this command creates wherever you want
    mkcert localhost
    ```
6. Download the Server Repository:

To complete the application, you'll need to download and set up the server side of Tech Tutor Hub. Follow the instructions in the [Server Repository] to get started.

7. Run the application
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
8. Open your browser and navigate to https://localhost:4200 to view the application
